# Auto-Text-completion-system-using-Neural-Language-model

Autocomplete, or word completion, is a modern-day feature in which the system predicts the rest of a word a user is typing. It is used in a variety of applications and platforms such as chatting apps, search engines, e-commerce websites. In this project, a Language Model is trained from scratch to build an autocomplete system. PyTorch is used to implement this project.
